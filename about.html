                <div id="biography">
                    <p>John is a second-generation Korean immigrant born and raised in Southern California. He is currently a law clerk at a firm specializing in intellectual property and employment law while also in his 3rd year of law school. </p>
                    <p>John lived with his mother, father, and older brother, but he grew up with a close-knit extended family that taught him the importance of bonds and community from a young age.</p>
                    <p>A firm believer in work-life balance from an early age, John was a scholar athlete throughout high school while still managing to find time to make life-long friends that he remains close with to this day. He eventually went on to attend the University of Southern California.</p>
                    <p>After graduating from USC, John eventually took a position as a product and project manager for a blockchain start-up company in the Philippines. While there, a close friend, Sarah, made it a point to visit, which led to the start of their relationship. Soon after, the start-up dissolved, and John was able to return home to California.</p>
                    <p>Once back in the States, John and Sarah’s relationship began to grow. They enjoyed traveling and spending time together, and in late 2019, they moved in together just in time for the COVID-19 lockdowns. It was during the lockdowns that John decided to go back to school for law.</p>
                    <p>They also adopted Ashe and Leo, their two well-loved cats, during this time. And in the spring of 2022, with the help of Ashe and Leo, John asked Sarah to marry him. She said yes.</p>
                    <p>John and Sarah got married in December of 2022. For their honeymoon, they visited Korea together. They ate plenty of good food and explored the hometown that Sarah had not seen in decades.</p>
                    <p>Through his experiences, he developed an open mind for life—finding joy in good food, new experiences, and the company of his loved ones. </p>
